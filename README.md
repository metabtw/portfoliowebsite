portfolio website html and css
I've created a responsive staff portfolio website using only HTML and CSS. Here are the key features:

**Navigation Menu**

Fixed top navigation with links to About Me, Works, and Contact sections
Hover effects for interactive feel


**About Me Section**

Placeholder profile image
Short professional summary
CV download button with hover effect

**Notes:**

I've used placeholder images. You'll want to replace these with your actual profile and project images.
The design is responsive and should look good on different screen sizes.
You can customize colors, fonts, and layout by modifying the CSS.
